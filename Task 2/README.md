# Healthcare Management System

## HIPAA Compliance Overview

This healthcare management system implements several key HIPAA compliance measures to ensure the security and privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI). Here's how HIPAA compliance is ensured:

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based authentication system with JWT tokens
   - Different roles (admin, organization, practitioner, patient) with appropriate access levels
   - Token expiration (11 hours) and validation
   - Secure token storage and transmission

2. **Data Security**
   - Password hashing using bcrypt
   - Secure MongoDB connection for data storage
   - Role-based access control for sensitive operations
   - Secure document handling through DocuSign integration

3. **Audit Controls**
   - Detailed logging of all operations
   - Timestamp tracking for all user actions
   - Secure audit trail maintenance

4. **Transmission Security**
   - JWT-based secure authentication
   - HTTPS enforcement through middleware
   - Secure document signing through DocuSign

5. **Documentation**
   - Clear separation of concerns through microservices
   - Well-documented API endpoints
   - Secure configuration management

## Architecture and Design Decisions

This system follows a microservices architecture with three main services:

1. **Appointment Service**
   - Handles appointment scheduling and management
   - Implements doctor availability checking
   - Manages patient-doctor relationships
   - Uses MongoDB for data persistence

2. **Document Service**
   - Manages document generation and signing
   - Integrates with DocuSign for secure document handling
   - Uses Puppeteer for PDF generation
   - Implements contract agreement workflows

3. **Organization Service**
   - Manages organization and user authentication
   - Handles user role management
   - Implements JWT-based authentication
   - Manages user registration and login

Key Design Decisions:

1. **Security**
   - JWT-based authentication across all services
   - Role-based access control
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Secure document handling

2. **Scalability**
   - Microservices architecture for independent scaling
   - Docker containerization for deployment
   - MongoDB for flexible data storage

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular code structure
   - Consistent error handling
   - Comprehensive logging

4. **Integration**
   - DocuSign integration for secure document signing
   - MongoDB for database operations
   - Express.js for RESTful API endpoints

This architecture ensures a robust, secure, and scalable healthcare management system while maintaining HIPAA compliance through proper access controls, data security measures, and audit capabilities.
